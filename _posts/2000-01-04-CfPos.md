# Call for Posters
Postgraduate taught (e.g. MA, MMus, etc.) and research students (e.g. PhD, MPhil, MRes, etc.) are invited to submit proposals for a poster on their original research. There will be a poster competition with prizes including Cambridge University Press book vouchers. The winning and runner-up posters will be featured on the RMA Student Blog.

Poster proposals should include a title and a 250-word abstract. Please submit them through the application portal, which will also require the following information: name, email address, institutional affiliation, programme of study and year, and technical requirements (if any).

Note that it will be the delegatesâ€™ responsibility to print their own poster. We can advise on local printers.
